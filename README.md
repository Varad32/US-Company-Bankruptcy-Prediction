# US Company Bankruptcy Prediction

The provided dataset is a novel dataset for bankruptcy prediction, focusing on American public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The dataset covers the period from 1999 to 2018 and includes accounting data from 8,262 distinct companies. It aims to predict bankruptcy events based on the financial indicators of these companies. The dataset is divided into three subsets: a training set (1999-2011), a validation set (2012-2014), and a test set (2015-2018) to evaluate the predictive capability of models in real-world scenarios.
